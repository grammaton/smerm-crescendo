This research investigates the topological variance of acoustical sound-shape in micro-rhythm relationship with the listener, through space.
Which is the more efficient approach to sound-shape analysis of an acoustical object? Is it possible to reproduce a sound-shape and compare its electroacoustic reproduction with the acoustical one? What is the emotional impact of the micro-rhythm relationship between mixed sound-shapes during a live concert?
The research will be carried using four-dimensional analysis strategies to conceptualize sound-shape of reality in the age of its virtual reproduction. RITMO and MusicLab are opportunities to explore the micro-rhythm relationships of complexity perception in the long-time formal experience.
