This research investigates the topological variance of acoustical sound-shape in micro-rhythm relationship with the listener, through space. Which is the more efficient approach to acoustical-object sound-shape analysis? Is the sound-shape reproduction possible and the comparison between its electroacoustic reproduction and the acoustical one? During live concerts what is the emotional impact of the micro-rhythm relationship between mixed sound-shapes?
The research will be carried using four-dimensional analysis strategies to conceptualize sound-shape of reality in the age of its virtual reproduction, to explore the micro-rhythm relationships of complexity perception in the long-time formal experience, even its enforcement in AI integration.
